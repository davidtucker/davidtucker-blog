I (David Tucker) am a software architect and developer as well as a speaker and writer within the industry.  I currently serve as the Vice President of Technology for <a href="http://www.universalmind.com/" target="_blank">Universal Mind</a>.

During my time at Universal Mind, I have worked to craft initiatives with companies like FedEx, Sony Music, Principal Financial Group, AT&T and many others.  I was the lead architect on projects like <a href="http://www.universalmind.com/blog/the-complete-digital-jimi-hendrix-experience-now-on-the-iphone-and-ipad" target="_blank">Jimi Hendrix: The Complete Experience</a> for Sony Music and Universal Mind's own Webby award winning [iPad Table](/articles/ipad-table-intro/).

In addition to development and architecture, I have worked with many of Universal Mind's clients to help formulate an effective enterprise technical digital strategy that meets to demands of the current (and future) landscape of the evolving digital space.

I have contributed articles for sites like Mashable, VentureBeat, Appolicious, Adobe's Inspire Magazine, as well as many others.  In addition, I am the autor of the AIR 1.5 Cookbook from O'Reilly and the AIR for Flash Develpers series at Lynda.com.
